# From 5.4 to 6.0

### Deprecations

#### Global projects

We deprecated root(global) namespace for projects.
So you need to move all your global projects under group/users manually before update or they will be automatically moved to the owner namespace during the update.

#### Teams

We introduce group membership in 6.0 as a replacement for teams.
The old combination of groups and teams was confusing for a lot of people.
And when the members of a team where changed this wasn't reflected in the project permissions.
In GitLab 6.0 you will be able to add members to a group with a permission level for each member.
These group members will have access to the projects in that group.
Any changes to group members will immediately be reflected in the project permissions.
You can even have multiple owners for a group, greatly simplifying administration.

### 0. Backup

It's useful to make a backup just in case things go south:
(With MySQL, this may require granting "LOCK TABLES" privileges to the GitLab user on the database version)

```bash
cd /home/git/gitlab
sudo -u git -H RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create
```

### 1. Stop server

    sudo service gitlab stop

### 2. Get latest code

```bash
cd /home/git/gitlab
sudo -u git -H git fetch
sudo -u git -H git checkout 6-0-stable
```

### 3. Update gitlab-shell

```bash
cd /home/git/gitlab-shell
sudo -u git -H git fetch
sudo -u git -H git checkout v1.7.0
```

### 4. Install additional packages

```bash
# For reStructuredText markup language support install required package:
sudo apt-get install python-docutils
```

### 5. Install libs, migrations, etc.

```bash
cd /home/git/gitlab

# MySQL
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without development test postgres --deployment

# PostgreSQL
sudo -u git -H bundle install --without development test mysql --deployment

sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake migrate_groups RAILS_ENV=production
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake migrate_global_projects RAILS_ENV=production
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake migrate_keys RAILS_ENV=production
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake migrate_inline_notes RAILS_ENV=production

# Clear redis cache
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake cache:clear RAILS_ENV=production

# Clear and precompile assets
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake assets:clean RAILS_ENV=production
sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
```

### 6. Update config files

Note: We switched from Puma in GitLab 5.4 to unicorn in GitLab 6.0.

* Make `/home/git/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml` the same as https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/config/gitlab.yml.example but with your settings.
* Make `/home/git/gitlab/config/unicorn.rb` the same as https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/config/unicorn.rb.example but with your settings.

### 7. Update Init script

```bash
sudo rm /etc/init.d/gitlab
sudo curl --output /etc/init.d/gitlab https://raw.github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/6-0-stable/lib/support/init.d/gitlab
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/gitlab
```

### 8. Start application

    sudo service gitlab start
    sudo service nginx restart

### 9. Check application status

Check if GitLab and its environment are configured correctly:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production

To make sure you didn't miss anything run a more thorough check with:

    sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:check RAILS_ENV=production

If all items are green, then congratulations upgrade complete!
